			<th>Book</th>
			<th>Comments</th>
			<th>Review</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</td>
			<td>Okay. The core premise--that digital products have taken away our agency + made us addictied--was strong, but the book didn't say much more than that. Everything else (e.g. tips, anecdotes, etc.) felt like verbose fluff.</td>
			<td>3/5</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design</td>	
			<td>I liked the book's glorifiaction of engineering as a human pursuit. I also appreciated the various stories--some were inspiring. That said, the book dragged on too long.</td>
			<td>3.5/5</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World</td>
			<td>Really interesting book. There wasn't a lot of information about Genghis Khan to actually say, but the context surrounding him and the little we do know was great.</td>
			<td>4.5/5</td>
		</tr>
